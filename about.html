      <p>
        I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Florida (UF), studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. My research concerns distributed multi-agent cooperation & control in stochastic environments. I use a combination of reinforcement learning, wireless communication, stochastic methods, graph theory, and information theory to discover innovative ways to achieve mission driven tasks in a distributed fashion. Before my stint at UF, I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University, also graduating from Barrett, the Honors College.

      <p>
        My early formative years grew up on a small hazelnut farm near Newberg, Oregon. I am grateful for my time spent there; it has deepened my appreciation for local custom and culture. Although my journey has taken me elsewhere, I maintain a fondness for the state, especially the beautiful nature (a picture from a hike is on the left).
      </p>

      <p>
	Beyond my studies and engineering research, I hold significant interest current events (local, national, and global). I also engage with the classics, theology, public policy, and political theory. Occasionally I will write down my thoughts and will post those essays here.
      </p>

      <p>
	Currently I live in Gainesville, Florida with my wife and two daughters. We have enjoyed our time here and try to contribute to the area just as much as it has given to us.
